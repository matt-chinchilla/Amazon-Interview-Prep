    "<p>Hash tables can also take up more space. <span style=\"color: red;\">Dynamic arrays are actually fixed-size arrays that resize themselves when they go beyond their capacity.</span> Hash tables are also implemented using a fixed size array - remember that the size is a limit set by the programmer. The problem is, resizing a hash table is much more expensive because every existing key needs to be re-hashed, and also a hash table may use an array that is significantly larger than the number of elements stored, resulting in a huge waste of space. Let's say you chose your limit as 10,000 items, but you only end up storing 10. Okay, you could argue that 10,000 is too large, but then what if your next test case ends up needing to store 100,000 elements? The point is, when you don't know how many elements you need to store, arrays are more flexible with resizing and not wasting space.</p>\n",

    "<p>A set is another data structure that is very similar to a hash table. It uses the same mechanism for hashing keys into integers.

    "<h3 id=\"arrays-as-keys\">Arrays as keys?</h3>\n",
    "<p>We said that being immutable is usually a requirement for being a hash map key. Arrays are mutable, so how do we store an ordered collection of elements as a key? Depending on the language you're using, there are several ways to convert an array into a unique immutable key. In Python, tuples are immutable, so it's as easy as doing <code>tuple(arr)</code>. Another trick is to convert the array into a string, delimited by some character that is guaranteed to not show up in any element. For example, use a comma to separate integers. <code>[1, 51, 163] --&gt; \"1,51,163\"</code>.</p>\n",

    "<p>In some languages, there may be data structures that allow you to associate mutable data structures to values. For example, in C++ there is <code>std::map</code>. Note that these are not hash maps, but they can be used to solve similar problems.</p>\n",
